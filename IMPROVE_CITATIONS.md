# To improve the citations on the Pantunis database

- ATMA is a "Data Raya" which means they have loads of collections of collections of data
- So for their "Sejuta Pantun" collection, the original authors, the original sources, the date of publishing/publication are mentioned
- But because I want to focus on reaching the main goal of Pantunis first: 1,000,000 pantuns in the database over 5 years, the original author for each pantun from ATMA is currently ATMA/Portal Malaycivilization/UKM
- So when the main goal is reached, I believe improving the citations and giving credit to the original author as specified in the ATMA dataset is one of the next steps to improve the quality of Pantunis

## Examples

This pantun which at point of writing is ID #103913:

Pergi ke desa memetik melati,
  Banyak rerama terbang di dusun;
Hilangkan rasa resah di hati,
  Mari bersama kita berpantun.

- Its original author according to the ATMA dataset is Datin Faridah Alias
- Its original source is Facebook Radio Klasik
- Its date of publishing/publication is 11 Februari 2020

But these details are not mentioned in the Pantunis database. So it'll be good if we can scrape/harvest these information to be shown in the Pantunis database as well

## Benefits

- Can implement more advanced search features according to the original authors, original sources etc. etc.
- Historically accurate records (to the extent of the accuracy of the ATMA dataset)
- Improve the overall quality of Pantunis database
