# pantunis-data

An effort to open-source and centralise the datasets for [Pantunis](https://www.pantunis.com/)

## Todo list

- [ ] Go through atma/pantun-2-kerat.txt to insert the 2-line pantuns into the Pantunis database
- [ ] Go through atma/bukan_4_kerat.txt to insert the pantuns which have more than 4 lines into the Pantunis database (and filter out the non-pantuns, please don't forget)
- [ ] Improve the citations on original authors of the pantuns. More info at [IMPROVE_CITATIONS.md](https://github.com/irfanzainudin/pantunis-data/blob/main/IMPROVE_CITATIONS.md).
